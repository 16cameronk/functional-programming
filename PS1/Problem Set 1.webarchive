<h2><a name="bg"></a>Background:  Fractals</h2>

<p>In this problem set, we will be experimenting with
<em>fractals</em>.  Among the most famous fractals are the Peano
Curve, the Hilbert Curve, the Cantor set, the Julia set, the
Mandelbrot set, and the von Koch Snowflake, the latter of which was
first described by Helge von Koch in 1904.  These figures are not only
aesthetically pleasing, but also have some important applications.
For example, the Hilbert curve is used in dithering and compressing
bit-mapped images.</p>

<p>A large class of fractals can be described by specifying an <span class="def">initiator</span> and a <span class="def">generator</span>.
The initiator is a starting shape, and the generator is a rule that
can be applied to refine the shape.  You can think of the initiator as
being a rough initial "approximation" of the fractal; we can then
apply the generator as many times as we like, to achieve better and
better approximations.</p>

<p>For the von Koch snowflake, the initiator is an equilateral
triangle with sides oriented in a clockwise direction, as illustrated
here (the arrows show the direction of orientation, and are not
considered part of the figure):</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/koch-init.gif" width="170" height="160" alt="von Koch snowflake initiator">
</p>

<p>The generator rule for the von Koch snowflake is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
For any oriented line segment, remove the middle third, and replace it
by two sides with length equal to that of the piece removed (thus
forming an equilateral triangle).  The two new segments should extend
to the left of the original segment, when facing in the direction of
orientation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, you would replace the following oriented segment:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/koch-seg1.gif" width="170" height="50" alt="a left-to-right oriented segment ______">
</p>

<p>by the four segments:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/koch-seg4.gif" width="170" height="74" alt="segment after middle third is replaced __/\__">
</p>

<p>To generate the fractal corresponding to a given initiator and
generator, we conceptually generate a sequence of figures, each more
refined than the last.  The first figure is the initiator itself.  The
(<var>i</var> + 1)<sup>st</sup> figure is produced by applying the
generator to each oriented line segment in the
<var>i</var><sup>th</sup> figure.  For the von Koch snowflake, the
first figure would be the equilateral triangle, the second a
six-pointed star, the third a six-pointed star with spikes on each
point, and so forth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/koch-level1.gif" width="64" height="64" alt="von Koch Level 1">

<img src="pics/koch-level3.gif" width="64" height="64" alt="von Koch Level 3">
</p>

<p>Mathematically, the fractal itself is the <em>limit</em> of these
approximations -- that is to say, it is the figure you get if you
continue applying the generator repeatedly without bound.  Fractals
have a number of fascinating mathematical properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>They are <em>self-similar</em>.  This means, roughly, that no
  matter how much you "zoom in", the object still looks the same.</p>

  </li><li><p>They are continuous, but nowhere differentiable.</p>

  </li><li><p>Their length is either 0, or infinite.</p>

  </li><li><p>One can define the <span class="def">dimension</span> of a
  fractal in a natural way, and it turns out that their dimension is
  not 1 like curves, nor 2 like surfaces, but somewhere in between
  (which is why they are called "fractals", since they have
  "fractional dimension").  The dimension of the von Koch snowflake is
  log(4)/log(3), or approximately 1.2619.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For more information about fractals and their mathematical
properties, we have a <a href="../../handouts/fractals/index.shtml"> short
handout</a> on the topic.  For even more depth on the subject,
see:</p>

<p class="ref">
<span class="title">Fractals: Form, Chance, and
Dimension</span>, by Benoit B. Mandelbrot<br>
	published by Freeman Press, 1977.
</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will construct level <var>k</var>
approximations to fractals.  These are the figures you get by stopping
the construction described above after <var>k</var> applications of
the generator.  For example, a level 0 von Koch snowflake consists of
just an equilateral triangle; a level 1 von Koch snowflake is the
six-pointed star, etc.  (You might try drawing a couple of successive
figures by hand, just to check your understanding).</p>

<p>These figures can be created without having to actually generate
the intermediate figures, by using a recursive strategy for drawing
each side of the figure.  A level 0 side is just a straight line.  A
level <var>k</var> side is made up of several level <var>k - 1</var>
sides.  In the von Koch snowflake, each level <var>k</var> side
consists of four level <var>k - 1</var> sides (because of the von Koch
generator rule).</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="bgcode"></a>Programming Fractals</h2>

<p>Based upon the above description of the von Koch fractal, we can
write a Racket procedure that draws an approximation of the snowflake
in a given direction, at a given length, and to a given number of
levels of replacement, starting from the current location.</p>

<p>To draw the figure at level zero, we simply draw a straight line of
the specified length in the given direction.  If the level is greater
than zero, we (recursively) draw four sides at one level less than the
current level, at one third the original length, in the appropriate
directions relative to the starting direction.</p>

<pre><code>
(define side
  (lambda ((length &lt;real&gt;) (heading &lt;real&gt;) (level &lt;integer&gt;))
    (if (zero? level)
        (drawto heading length)
        (let ((len/3 (/ length 3))
              (lvl-1 (- level 1)))
          (side len/3 heading lvl-1)
          (side len/3 (- heading pi/3) lvl-1)
          (side len/3 (+ heading pi/3) lvl-1)
          (side len/3 heading lvl-1)))))
</code></pre>

<p>The procedure <tt>drawto</tt> is supplied by the graphics library
defined in <a href="cs230-graphics.scm"><tt>cs230-graphics.scm</tt></a>.
It draws a line segment by moving the graphics "pen" in the specified
direction for the specified distance.  The names <tt>pi</tt> and
<tt>pi/3</tt> are defined as:</p>

<pre><code>
(define pi (* 4.0 (atan 1.0)))
(define pi/3 (/ pi 3))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <tt>pi/3</tt> is just a name, not a piece of code to
compute pi divided by 3 (nicely mnemonic names of this kind are one of
the neat features of a language like Racket).  The file
<tt>cs230-graphics.scm</tt> also defines the appropriate values for the
names <tt>pi/2</tt> and <tt>pi/4</tt>.</p>

<p>We can draw the level <var>k</var> snowflake by drawing three level
<var>k</var> sides oriented at 0 radians, 2 * pi/3 radians, and -2 *
pi/3 radians:</p>

<pre><code>
(define snowflake:0
  (lambda ((length &lt;real&gt;) (level &lt;integer&gt;))
    (side length 0.0 level)
    (side length (* 2 pi/3) level)
    (side length (- (* 2 pi/3)) level)))
</code></pre>

<dl class="note">
<dt>Note:</dt>

<dd>The graphics environment we are using specifies direction as an
angle in radians, not degrees.  Also, this environment defines zero
radians as horizontal to the right -- positive angles increase
clockwise, negative angles anti-clockwise, as illustrated here:

<h2><a name="prob1"></a>Problem 1: Different Initiators &amp;
Generators</h2>

<p>The snowflake figure is just one of a large family of figures that
can be drawn using the same general method.  Changing the initiator or
the generator (or both) can completely change the shape of the
figure.</p>

<h3>What to Do</h3>

<p><strong>Write a new generator function</strong> called
<tt>flip-side</tt>, in which the first half of the oriented line
segment is replaced with the two equal sides of an isoceles right
triangle extending to the left, and the last half is replaced with the
two sides of an isoceles right triangle extending to the right.  The
result is illustrated in this figure:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/flipside.gif" width="400" height="125" alt="Illustration of the flip-side transformation">
</p>

<p>In the new figure, the middle segment should be considered as a
single long segment, not two separate segments of equal length (this
makes a difference in what the procedure does at the next level).</p>

<p><strong>Write a new initiator function</strong> called
<tt>square-snowflake:1</tt> that is based on a square instead of a
triangle, and uses <tt>flip-side</tt> as a generator instead of the
original <tt>side</tt> procedure given in <tt>cs230.ps1.scm</tt>.  Try out
your new initiator and see what kind of image it generates.  Your
square initiator should be oriented thus:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/koch-square.gif" width="160" height="160" alt="Square initiator, clockwise from top left">
</p>

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

<p>For Problem 1, please submit a listing of the Racket code for the
new functions <tt>flip-side</tt> and <tt>square-snowflake:1</tt> you
wrote.  For output, please print the snowflake generated by the
following call:</p>

<pre><code>
(square-snowflake:1 150 3)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2><a name="prob2"></a>Problem 2: Generalizing the System</h2>

<p>This problem deals with functional abstraction, and the use of
functions as parameters.</p>

<p>In the initiator given to you (<tt>snowflake:0</tt>) and in the
initiator you wrote for Problem 1 (<tt>square-snowflake:1</tt>), the
shape of the object is "hard-coded".  But it makes sense that you
could define fractals using <em>any</em> combination of generator and
initiator.  For instance, we ought to be able to use the
<tt>square-snowflake:1</tt> initiator with the original von Koch
generator function.  To make this work, we need some general way to
glue together a generator and an initiator so that we can try out
different combinations.</p>

<p>One idea is to <span class="def">parameterize</span> the initiator
with a generator.  In other words, we could modify our initiator
functions so that they take the generator as an argument.</p>

<h3>What to Do</h3>

<p><strong>Copy the definitions</strong> of <tt>snowflake:0</tt> and
<tt>square-snowflake:1</tt> that we gave you in <a href="cs230.ps1.scm"><tt>cs230.ps1.scm</tt></a>, <strong>and modify these
copies</strong> to create new functions named <tt>snowflake:2</tt> and
<tt>square-snowflake:2</tt> that take a generator as an additional
argument, and invoke this generator, instead of a hard-wired one.
(The type of a function in Swindle is <tt>&lt;function&gt;</tt>).</p>

<p>Try out all four possible combinations of initiators and
generators:</p>

<pre><code>
<span class="comment">;; van Koch initiator with van Koch generator</span>
(snowflake:2 200 3 side)

<span class="comment">;; van Koch initiator with flip-side generator</span>
(snowflake:2 150 3 flip-side)

<span class="comment">;; square initiator with van Koch generator</span>
(square-snowflake:2 200 3 side)

<span class="comment">;; square initiator with flip-side generator</span>
(square-snowflake:2 150 3 flip-side)
</code></pre>

<p>The first expression of these four should give you the same figure
as the original <tt>snowflake:0</tt> code did.</p>

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

<p>For Problem 2, please submit a listing of the procedures
<tt>snowflake:2</tt> and <tt>square-snowflake:2</tt>, as well as a
printout of all four generated snowflakes.  Make sure each of the
printouts is properly labelled.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="prob3"></a>Problem 3: Inverting the Generator</h2>

<p>This problem further examines the use of functions as
parameters.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the generator should stay the same all the
time, even during the generation of a particular figure.  Interesting
designs can be obtained by "inverting" the generator on some levels of
the drawing process.</p>

<p>By "inverting" the generator, we mean that when the original
generator turns left, the inverted generator should turn right; when
the original generator turns right, the inverted generator should turn
left.  Note that inversion affects only the <em>direction of
turns</em>, and not the orientation of the underlying line.  This is
illustrated by the following figure -- the line still goes
left-to-right, but the turns are all reversed:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics/inversion.gif" width="340" height="74" alt="Illustration of the effect of inversion">
</p>

<p>We can easily invert an arbitrary generator by changing the signs
of the angles that we add to the original heading.  The decision
whether to use a regular or inverted generator could be a function of
the level -- for example, we might decide to invert the generator when
the level is an odd number, and not to invert when the level is an
even number.  Alternatively, we might decide to invert on every third
level, or we might decide not to invert at all.</p>

<p>In order to support an arbitrary inversion strategy, we need to
pass an additional parameter <tt>inverter</tt> to the initiator, which
forwards it along to the generator function.  This <tt>inverter</tt>
should be a function, and the generator will actually <em>call</em>
the inverter function, passing it the current level as a parameter.
The inverter function will return -1 if the direction <em>should</em>
be inverted, and 1 if it should not.</p>

<h3>What to Do</h3>

<p><strong>Copy and modify the functions</strong> <tt>snowflake:2</tt>
and <tt>side</tt> to obtain new functions named <tt>snowflake-inv</tt>
and <tt>side-inv</tt> which have an added parameter called
<tt>inverter</tt>, of the appropriate type, and implement the changes
described above.  To test your code, evaluate this expression:</p>

<pre><code>
(snowflake-inv 100 3 side-inv 
               (lambda ((level &lt;integer&gt;)) 1))
</code></pre>

<p>This should produce the same figure as the original
<tt>snowflake</tt> code from the assignment.</p>

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

<p>For Problem 3, please submit listings of the <tt>snowflake-inv</tt>
and <tt>side-inv</tt> procedures, along with a printout of the
snowflakes generated by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>
(snowflake-inv 150 3 side-inv
               (lambda ((level &lt;integer&gt;)) 
	         (if (odd? level) 1 -1)))

(snowflake-inv 150 3 side-inv
               (lambda ((level &lt;integer&gt;)) 
	         (if (even? level) 1 -1)))
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2><a name="prob4"></a>Problem 4: Calculating the Length of the
Snowflake Figure</h2>

<p>Now, instead of drawing a snowflake figure, suppose we would
like to compute the total length of all the line segments that
would be drawn, if we were to actually generate the figure.  We
can do this using the same recursive structure that we employed
in the previous problems, but this time we won't be drawing
anything.</p>

<h3>What to Do</h3>

<p><strong>Write two new procedures</strong> called
<tt>side-length</tt> and <tt>snowflake-length</tt>.  These procedures
should take the same number and types of arguments as the
<tt>side</tt> and <tt>snowflake</tt> procedures you wrote for <a href="#prob3">Problem 3</a>, but instead of drawing,
<tt>snowflake-length</tt> should return the total length of the figure
that <tt>snowflake</tt> would have drawn, i.e., the total distance
moved by the pen, given the same arguments.</p>

<p>The overall recursive structure of the two new procedures should be
the same as the originals, except that they should return the
<em>length</em> of the part of the figure which would have been drawn.
You do not need to write <tt>flip-side-length</tt> or
<tt>square-snowflake-length</tt>; the principle would be the same in
those cases.</p>

<dl class="note">
<dt>Note:</dt>

<dd>You can check the accuracy of your results by noticing that the
total length of the figure increases as a geometric series:  Each
time the generator level is increased by one, the total length
increases by a constant factor.  Don't just make your function compute
this directly, however; we want you to use the recursive structure to
compute the length in your solution.  This trick merely gives you a
way to make sure you're getting the right numbers out.
</dd></dl>

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

<p>For Problem 4, please hand in a listing of the procedures
<tt>side-length</tt> and <tt>snowflake-length</tt>, as well as a
printout of the output generated by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>
(snowflake-length 100.0 3 side-length 
                  (lambda ((level &lt;integer&gt;)) 1))
</code></pre>
